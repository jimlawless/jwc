# jwc
A simple command-line word counter

I needed a simple word counter program, so I quickly wrote this one.  Then, I lamented that it couldn't take input from stdin, so I added that.

Jim's Word Count (jwc) v1.02 by Jim Lawless https://jimlawless.net/

Syntax:

        jwc text-file-name

or

        jwc -i
        ...for input from stdin...
    
The output is a count of strings with no spaces appearing in the specified text file.
